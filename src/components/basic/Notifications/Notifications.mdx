#### Details

Toast messages are used to show real time system responses to the user.

Its important to make sure that the user receives the right level of response. Make sure that not every actions leads to a toast notification. Instead a valid amount of messages should be used.

The toast messages can get configured to auto close or close on user action only.

If a user does hover on a toast message, the auto closure timer is stopped and will only proceed as soon as the user did stop the mouse over. The element will slowly move out of the screen when closing.
