### Spinner

For page elements with a database connection or backend content requests with potential loading delays (latency), a loading spinner should be used.

User Benefit:

Spinners are used to shows the user that an element is currently still being loaded at the respective position in the page flow.

An indicator of how far this element has already been loaded or how much time is still needed until it is fully loaded is only displayed if this can be calculated in a technically reliable way. Otherwise, only the "Loading Spinner" is displayed without a completeness indicator.

Other page elements are loaded without the loading status indicator.
