#### Details

A search bar allows people to search through a large collection of values by typing text into a field.

#### Interaction

A search bar can be displayed alone, or in a navigation bar or content view. When displayed in a navigation bar, a search bar can be pinned to the navigation bar so it's always accessible, or it can be collapsed until the user swipes down to reveal it.

#### Context and usage

Use a search bar instead of a standard input field to implement the search function.
Implement a clear button to give the user the chance to delete the entered value.
Ensure that the user can terminate the search with a cancel button.

#### Guidance

- Allow the search bar to be as wide as possible, but a minimum of 30 characters wide. This allows users to enter multiple search terms and still be able to see all of them. The more users can see their search terms, the easier it is to review, verify, and submit their search query.
- The magnifying glass has been shown to be almost universally recognized by users as an indicator of search, and doesnâ€™t need to be visually paired with the word "Search" as long as it remains for screen readers.
- On a site's home page the search function should appear as a search box instead of a link so users can locate it easily.
- Don't offer advanced search as the default option. The majority of people will do a simple search with one or two search terms. If advanced search is offered, it increases the likelihood of a person making a mistake in their query.
- Even if the search bar isn't visually displaying a label, the form field should include a label for screen reader users.
- The search button itself should be a submit button for the form to reduce the number of keystrokes required to use the form.
