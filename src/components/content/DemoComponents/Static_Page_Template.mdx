### Implementation

To create a new page or enhance an existing page, the following steps need to get performed

<br />

#### New Page creation

If a complete new page with the usage static data templates is planned, the page need to get introduced inside the portal frontend repo as well as inside the asset repo.
The frontend repo is needed to introduce the page, permissions to the page as well as the navigation.

<br />
<br />

#### Enhancing an existing page

For enhancing an existing page, the asset files inside the assets repo => /public/assets/content/de/.... need to get enhanced.
Please ensure that you extend all language files and not only one.

By adding a new template (as mentioned above) inside the content files, the portal page will get automatically extended by the new content.
